    alt="Woman in a Lake touching her face."
  />

  <p>
    Photo taken at Cidreira, Brazil. Accompanied by my stepfather, my mom and
    two friends, Erico and Ana Luisa. We decided to stop by a Lake and have some
    snacks. Ana Luisa was shy and did not want to take pictures but I took this
    beautiful spontaneous shot while she was cleaning her face and she loved it.

  <h3>"Reflections"</h3>

    height="400"
    alt="Portrait of a woman. The picture has a ghost effect, 
    made by increasing the exposure of the picture and making it look like the person 
    has two faces."
  />

  <p>
    One of my most important pictures since it was the first professional
    picture I took. It was for a small project from a group of artists in
    Toronto.

  <h3>"Cybermom"</h3>

    height="600"
    alt="Picture of a siluet on a bridge with blue and pink lights coming from above, at night."
  />

  <p>
    The name "Cybermom" is auto explanatory, it has the cyberpunk look and...
    the person in the picture is my mom! Taken in Toronto, during a visit to a
    light event that happened at night.

  <h3>"Mary Fantasy"</h3>
  <img

    height="500"
    alt="An woman standing looking up with a castle behind her"
  />

  <p>
    Photo taken at Casa Loma, Toronto, Canada, with my mexican friend, Maria
    Fernanda.

  <h3>"6Toes"</h3>

  <img
    src="../assets/images/6Toes.jpg"
    height="600"
    alt="A cat sitting on the snow with the CN Tower at the back"
  />

  <p>
    The name "6Toes" is not only because the cat's name is Six Toes but also
    because the CAT HAS SIX TOES!!! YES! SIX... TOES. And I also like the way it
    is written with the number 6 instead of writing "six" because the CN Tower
    is in the back of the picture and Toronto is also known by “The 6”.

  <h3>"Cocobolo"</h3>

  <img
    src="../assets/images/Luana.jpg"
    height="600"
    alt="An woman dancing on a green grass"
  />

  <p>
    This is my girlfriend! This picture was taken at my grandparents farm,
    lovely and special person at a lovely and special place. Named this picture
    Cocobolo because it is a name of a rare wood.
  </p>

  <h3>"Grey"</h3>

  <img
    src="../assets/images/Grey.jpg"
    height="600"
    alt="A squirrel eating nuts on a handrail"
  />

  <p>
    Grey, the squirrel. This photo is special to me not because of the beauty of
    the picture per se. But because of the emotion that I feel seeing it. My mom
    was going through hard times and this squirrel made her very happy back
    then.
